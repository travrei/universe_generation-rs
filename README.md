# Universe Generation Demo in Rust
This is a Rust implementation of a **procedurally generated universe**, inspired by [Jonkero's video on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@Jonkero).

## About
After watching Jonkero's excellent video on this matter, I decided to try recreate but in Rust.
>ðŸ’¡ Some things I had to figure out on my own â€” for example, imgui required using unsafe and I wanted to avoid that.

>ðŸ’¡ I also couldn't figure out how to integrate egui into the project...

>ðŸ’¡ Additionally, I had to tweak the perfectly_hash_them function a bit to make it work properly with Rust.

## ðŸ“¹ Inspiration

Original concept by **Jonkero** â€“ [Watch the video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el7p-HC77g8)

> Big thanks to Jonkero for sharing the knowledge and inspiration!
